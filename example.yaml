Ice Cream Shoppe:
  Body:
    Text: The body is lying under the dispensers of the soft serve machine, and is covered in ice cream.
  Soft Serve Machine:
    Text: The handles of the soft serve machine have been pulled down to constantly produce ice cream. They are kept this way by a rope that is also tied to the body.
  Hands:
    Text: The hands of the body have been removed and placed on the counter, but the pinkies are nowhere to be found.
  Knife:
    Text: A knife has been stabbed into the chest of the body. It is serrated and doesn’t seem like the kind you’d find in the kitchen.
  Ice Cream Cone:
    Text: An ice cream has been shoved down the victim’s throat
  Rope:
    Text: The rope used to hold down the machine handles seems to be tied weirdly around the body, and one end of it is frayed as if it has been cut.


Main Lobby:
  Body:
    Text: Zada’s body is lying on the floor rather unceremoniously
    Next:
      Neck:
        Text: There is major rope burn around her neck, but the rope isn’t attached.
      Stomach:
        Text: The stomach of the victim has been ripped open, and their guts have been strewn around
  Chandelier:
    Text: Attached to the chandelier is a portion of rope. It’s been cut on the end not tied to the chandelier
  Paper Scraps:
    Text: There are bits of paper scraps strewn around the body like Parmesan on spaghetti. You can’t read what it says though, as blood has soaked into the paper
